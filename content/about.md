## Disclaimer

### We are not following Rules

**Labs** is not an academic entity. Because of this, we are not afraid to do something considered taboo in academic world.
We will use [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_is_not_a_reliable_source) as a reference when we need to.
We will literally copy texts from sources in our logs if they are already clear (we will reference the source).
We are not afraid of being wrong.
