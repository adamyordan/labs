This is a placeholder for the first post in this blog. This placeholder marks the starting point of one project: **Artificial Consciousness**.

[Artificial consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_consciousness) (AC) is a field related to artificial intelligence and cognitive robotics.
The aim of the theory of artificial consciousness is to "Define that which would have to be synthesized were consciousness to be found in an engineered artifact" ([Aleksander 1995](https://web.archive.org/web/19970302014628/http://www.ee.ic.ac.uk/research/neural/publications/iwann.html)).

Artificial consciousness concepts are also pondered in the philosophy of artificial intelligence through questions about mind, consciousness, and mental states.


## Project Goal

There is no specific goal currently. We will try to construct a model of artificial consciousness that can emulate consciousness.
