In [Facing Up to the Problem of Consciousness (1955)](http://consc.net/papers/facing.html), the philosopher David Chalmers introduced the term “hard problem” of consciousness, in contrasts with the “easy problems”.

> The really hard problem of consciousness is the problem of experience. When we think and perceive there is a whir of information processing, but there is also a subjective aspect.

The Hard Problem concerns about the explaining how it is that a physical system can have vivid experiences with seemingly intrinsic qualities ([_qualia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia)). Example: [the quality of deep blue](https://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/8227), [the sensation of middle C](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bo0iOpNa-Kw).

In contrast, the easy problems represents some ability / function / behaviour:

* The ability to discriminate, categorise, and react to environmental stimuli;
* The integration of information by a cognitive system;
* The report-ability of mental states;
* The ability of a system to access its own internal states;
* The focus of attention;
* The control of behaviour;
* The difference between wakefulness and sleep.


## Aspects of Consciousness
There are aspects generally deemed necessary for a machine to be artificially conscious.

[Bernard Baars (1988)](https://web.archive.org/web/20040816183746/http://vesicle.nsi.edu/users/baars/BaarsConsciousnessBook1988/) suggested:

> Definition and Context Setting; Adaptation and Learning; Editing, Flagging and Debugging; Recruiting and Control Prioritizing and Access-Control; Decision-making or Executive Function; Analogy-forming Function; Metacognitive and Self-monitoring Function; Autoprogramming and Self-maintenance Function.

[Igor Aleksander (1995)](https://web.archive.org/web/19970302014628/http://www.ee.ic.ac.uk/research/neural/publications/iwann.html) suggested:

> The Brain is a State Machine; Inner Neuron Partitioning; Conscious and Unconscious States; Perceptual Learning and Memory; Prediction; The Awareness of Self; Representation of Meaning; Learning Utterances; Learning Language; Will; Instinct; Emotion.

In general, these aspects can be categorized as follows:

* Awareness
* Memory
* Learning
* Anticipation
* Subjective experience (qualia)

## Approach for our Artificial Consciousness project
The existence of this “hard problem” is controversial, and there are some disputes that there is no solution for the problem.
Thus, in my **Project:Labs::ArtificialConsciousness**, I will try to tackle the easy problems first, while slowly expanding the capability mentioned in consciousness aspects.
