      <description>In Facing Up to the Problem of Consciousness (1955), the philosopher David Chalmers introduced the term “hard problem” of consciousness, in contrasts with the “easy problems”.
 The really hard problem of consciousness is the problem of experience. When we think and perceive there is a whir of information processing, but there is also a subjective aspect.
 The Hard Problem concerns about the explaining how it is that a physical system can have vivid experiences with seemingly intrinsic qualities (qualia).</description>

      <description>This is a placeholder for the first post in this blog. This placeholder marks the starting point of one project: Artificial Consciousness.
Artificial consciousness (AC) is a field related to artificial intelligence and cognitive robotics. The aim of the theory of artificial consciousness is to &amp;ldquo;Define that which would have to be synthesized were consciousness to be found in an engineered artifact&amp;rdquo; (Aleksander 1995).
Artificial consciousness concepts are also pondered in the philosophy of artificial intelligence through questions about mind, consciousness, and mental states.</description>
