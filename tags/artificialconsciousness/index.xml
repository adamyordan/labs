      <description>This is a placeholder for the first post in this blog. This placeholder marks the starting point of one project: Artificial Consciousness.
Artificial consciousness (AC) is a field related to artificial intelligence and cognitive robotics. The aim of the theory of artificial consciousness is to &amp;ldquo;Define that which would have to be synthesized were consciousness to be found in an engineered artifact&amp;rdquo; (Aleksander 1995).
Artificial consciousness concepts are also pondered in the philosophy of artificial intelligence through questions about mind, consciousness, and mental states.</description>
