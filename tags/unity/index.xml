      <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s Goal In this post, I will try to create a 3D visualization using Unity and connect it to our agent written in python. You may want to read the previous post about Alexander AI concept because we will reuse a lot of the concepts. (In the future, today&amp;rsquo;s version will be referenced as Barton).
Idea I will still continue using the concepts introduced in previous post. However, there is an update that should be done to accommodate remote functionality.</description>
